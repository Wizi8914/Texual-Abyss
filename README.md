# 📜 About

Textual Abyss is a group project for my school, it's a text game inspired by [Colossal cave adventure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3etkSoHrR8) or [Zork 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWNgQdybISA).

I recommend that you don't steal this code if you have a similar school project. However, you are free to explore and modify it for your own use.
